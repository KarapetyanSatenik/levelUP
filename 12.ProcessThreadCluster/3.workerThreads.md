## Worker thread

As per the Node documentation, The worker_threads module enables the use of threads that execute JavaScript in parallel. 

- Workers (threads) are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations. They will not help much with I/O-intensive work. Node.js’s built-in asynchronous I/O operations are more efficient than Workers can be.

Unlike child_process or cluster, worker_threads can share memory. They do so by transferring ArrayBuffer instances or sharing SharedArrayBuffer instances.
worker thread provides you APIs to deal with CPU intensive tasks while still maintaining the responsive application.
Each worker thread is the new instance of the event loop, creating a worker thread gives you a new event loop, so the event loop running in the main thread is free to take new requests if you run CPU intensive task in a worker thread. one good thing is if any worker thread running out of memory then it will not take down other worker thread.
Worker threads don’t have all the mechanisms for thread synchronization like in other multi-threaded programming languages, however, we can pass messages back and forth between a worker thread and the main thread.

```js

const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

if(isMainThread) {
    console.log('main thread start...');
    const worker = new Worker(__filename);
    worker.on('message', (msg) => {
        console.log(`Worker: ${msg}`);
      });
    console.log("doing some random work in main thread..!!");
}else{
    parentPort.postMessage('hello from worker thread');
    cpuIntensiveTask(1000);
    parentPort.postMessage('i am working');
    cpuIntensiveTask(1000);
    parentPort.postMessage('task is done..!!');
}

function cpuIntensiveTask(timeInSecond) {
    const end = Date.now() + timeInSecond;
    while (Date.now() < end) { }
  }
```

Here you can observe that the main event loop was not blocked because of the worker thread doing some CPU intensive task. we immediately get the output from the main thread. the message is passed back from the worker got handled and logged later, the cpuIntensiveTask function is still blocking an event loop. It is blocking the Worker’s event loop, which left the main event loop free, to continue processing the user’s request.

Here we saw how we can pass messages from the worker thread to the main thread. now let’s see how we can pass data along with the messages from the main thread to the worker thread.
for that, we have to importworkerData from worker_thread then use it to pass data to the worker by passing an object to the worker constructor.

```js

const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

if(isMainThread) {
  console.log('main thread start...');

  const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
    workerData: {
      prefix: 'Received message',
      timeInSecond: 1000
    }
  });

  worker.on('message', (msg) => {
    console.log(`Worker: ${msg}`);
  });

  worker.postMessage('Done with my work.');
  
  console.log("doing some random work in main thread..!!");

} else {
  parentPort.on('message', (msg) => {
    console.log(`${workerData.prefix}: ${msg}`);
  });

  parentPort.postMessage('hello from worker thread');
  cpuIntensiveTask(workerData.timeInSecond);
  parentPort.postMessage('i am working');
  cpuIntensiveTask(workerData.timeInSecond);
  parentPort.postMessage('task is done..!!');
}

function cpuIntensiveTask(timeInSecond) {
    const end = Date.now() + timeInSecond;
    while (Date.now() < end) { }
}

```
## second part

Worker threads can be used to solve the above-mentioned caveats with child processes because worker threads share memory and communication between threads is possible. Essentially the difference between worker threads and child processes is same as the difference between a thread and a process.Ideally, the number of threads created should be equal to number of cpu cores.

let's compare the default single thread and multi thread with worker threads performance.

singleThreadServer.js
```js
const express = require("express")
Copy
const app = express()

function sumOfPrimes(n) {
  var sum = 0
  for (var i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    for (var j = 2; j <= i / 2; j++) {
      if (i % j == 0) {
        break
      }
    }
    if (j > i / 2) {
      sum += i
    }
  }
  return sum
}

app.get("/sumofprimes", (req, res) => {
  const startTime = new Date().getTime()
  const sum = sumOfPrimes(req.query.number)
  const endTime = new Date().getTime()
  res.json({
    number: req.query.number,
    sum: sum,
    timeTaken: (endTime - startTime) / 1000 + " seconds",
  })
})

app.listen(6767, () => console.log("listening on port 6767"))
```

single-threaded-server

It takes around 50 seconds to calculate the sum of prime numbers up to 600 thousand

sumOfPrimesWorker.js
```js
const { workerData, parentPort } = require("worker_threads")
Copy
//workerData will be the second argument of the Worker constructor in multiThreadServer.js

const start = workerData.start
const end = workerData.end

var sum = 0
for (var i = start; i <= end; i++) {
  for (var j = 2; j <= i / 2; j++) {
    if (i % j == 0) {
      break
    }
  }
  if (j > i / 2) {
    sum += i
  }
}

parentPort.postMessage({
  //send message with the result back to the parent process
  start: start,
  end: end,
  result: sum,
})
see code on github
multiThreadServer.js

const express = require("express")
Copy
const app = express()
const { Worker } = require("worker_threads")

function runWorker(workerData) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    //first argument is filename of the worker
    const worker = new Worker("./sumOfPrimesWorker.js", {
      workerData,
    })
    worker.on("message", resolve) //This promise is gonna resolve when messages comes back from the worker thread
    worker.on("error", reject)
    worker.on("exit", code => {
      if (code !== 0) {
        reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`))
      }
    })
  })
}

function divideWorkAndGetSum() {
  // we are hardcoding the value 600000 for simplicity and dividing it
  //into 4 equal parts

  const start1 = 2
  const end1 = 150000
  const start2 = 150001
  const end2 = 300000
  const start3 = 300001
  const end3 = 450000
  const start4 = 450001
  const end4 = 600000
  //allocating each worker seperate parts
  const worker1 = runWorker({ start: start1, end: end1 })
  const worker2 = runWorker({ start: start2, end: end2 })
  const worker3 = runWorker({ start: start3, end: end3 })
  const worker4 = runWorker({ start: start4, end: end4 })
  //Promise.all resolve only when all the promises inside the array has resolved
  return Promise.all([worker1, worker2, worker3, worker4])
}

app.get("/sumofprimeswiththreads", async (req, res) => {
  const startTime = new Date().getTime()
  const sum = await divideWorkAndGetSum()
    .then(
      (
        values //values is an array containing all the resolved values
      ) => values.reduce((accumulator, part) => accumulator + part.result, 0) //reduce is used to sum all the results from the workers
    )
    .then(finalAnswer => finalAnswer)

  const endTime = new Date().getTime()
  res.json({
    number: 600000,
    sum: sum,
    timeTaken: (endTime - startTime) / 1000 + " seconds",
  })
})

app.listen(7777, () => console.log("listening on port 7777"))

```

multi-thread-server

It takes only half of the time required for the single-threaded server
This is because, we are dividing the work into 4 equal parts and allocating each part to a worker and parallelly (at the same time) executing the task.

full-cpu

The 4 threads(workers) are running on all 4 cores of the cpu
