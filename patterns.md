Every JavaScript developer aims to write readable, reusable code.
As your applications become larger, it becomes increasingly important to structure your code well. You can do this with design patterns. Not all of the patterns are necessary for use in JavaScript.
There are 3 type of design patterns 
1. structural - for identifying ways to realize relationships between objects
2. behavioral - for handling communication between different objects
3. creational - (For handling object creation mechanism)

- Creational
1. Factory
This pattern can accept different arguments and return corresponding value defined in it.
2. Builder
Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects by providing a step by step approach.
3. Prototype
The Prototype design pattern relies on the JavaScript prototypical inheritance. The prototype model is used mainly for creating objects in performance-intensive situations.

- Structural
1. Composite
Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

2. Decorator
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

- Behavioral 
1. command
2. strategy
3. visitor
4. state
