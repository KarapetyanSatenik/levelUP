## Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service):

- SQS is a fully managed message queuing service.

- It allows you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications by providing a reliable and highly scalable message queuing solution.

- Messages are stored in queues and processed by consumers (receivers) at their own pace.
Supports both standard and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues.

- SQS ensures message delivery and provides features like message retention, dead-letter queues, and long polling.

- Common use cases include decoupling application components, workload scaling, and asynchronous processing.
