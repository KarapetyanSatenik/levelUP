Cloud computing is a delivery model, It is like renting a computer over the internet instead of owning one. Instead of buying and maintaining your own hardware and software, you can access resources such as servers, storage, databases, and software applications from a cloud service provider. This allows you to scale up or down easily based on your needs, pay only for what you use, and access your data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection. It's like having a virtual office or computer that you can access whenever you need it, without the hassle of managing physical infrastructure.
