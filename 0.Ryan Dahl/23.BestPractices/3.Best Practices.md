## Variable Best Practices

1. Use individual statements to create variables 

Don't do 
```js
let name, surname, age;
name = "Satenik"
```
- esLint rule
"one-var":["error", "never"]

2. Prefer cont, then let
- "prefer-const" : "error"

3. Create descriptive variable names
- "camelcase" : "error"

4. Remove unused variables

- "no-unused-vars" " "error"

5. Don't assign variables in chains

- "no-multi-assign" : "error"

6. Standardize quotes("", '')

- "quotes" : ["error", "single"]


## Assign Value Best Practices.md

1. Create arrays and objects using literals

rThis is perfectly valid JavaScript, but stylistically, these constructors are often not the best choice. Because the array constructor accepts either a numeric argument for the number of elements or a comma separated list of values, there's a pitfall. 

If I want to create an empty array, I can use new array and pass the value zero. Or, if I want to create an array with some numbers in it, I can pass those as comma separated values. But if I want to create an array with a single element whose value is a number, then relying on the array constructor can have an unexpected outcome. 

## Type casting

1. Rely on implicit Boolean values in conditionals

Don't use
```js
if(!!objName)
```
- "no-extra-boolean-cast" : "error"

2. Type cast Booleans using double negation


# Comparing values

1. Use triple-character equality operators(===)

- "eqeqeq" : "error"

2. Don't use Yoda conditions

It's pretty standard in JavaScript to write the variable first, and then the literal value second in comparisons.

- "yoda" : "error"

3. Use ternary statements judiciously

- "no-unneeded-ternary" : "error"
- "no-nested-ternary" : "error"

4. Add parentheses to clarify logic
