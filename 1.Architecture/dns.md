What is DNS and why is it important?

Answer: DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1). DNS is crucial because it allows users to access websites using domain names instead of having to remember complex IP addresses.

A DNS resolver is a server on the internet that translates domain names into IP addresses. When a device makes a DNS query, it is sent to the DNS resolver, which then processes the request and returns the corresponding IP address to the device.

A DNS query is a request made from a device (like a computer or smartphone) to a DNS server to resolve a domain name into an IP address. This process is necessary for the device to connect to the desired website or service.
