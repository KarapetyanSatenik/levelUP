## What is FTP?

FTP stands for “File Transfer Protocol.” It is an internet service which is designed to establish a connection to the specific server or computer. Therefore, users can transfer file (download) or transfer data/files to their computer or the FTP server.

The FTP protocol also includes commands which you can use to execute operations on any remote computer. For example, to change directories, show folder contents, create folders or delete files. It is built on a client-server architecture. FTP allows you to utilize separate control and data connections between the client and server applications. It helps to solve the issue of different end host configurations.

## What is SFTP?

SFTP (full form SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a part of the SSH protocol suite. It provides secure file transfers over SSH to provide access to all the shell accounts on a remote SFTP server.

SSH is a protocol for secure remote access to a machine over untrusted networks. SSH is a replacement for telnet, rsh, rlogin. SFTP verifies the identity of the client and once a secured connection is established information is exchanged.
