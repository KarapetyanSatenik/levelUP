## Small Functions 

In the previous lesson, you reviewed guidelines for writing clean functions. The first guideline was functions should be small. A truly small function can only do one thing, so if a function does more than one thing, it’s not small enough—period.

### Extracting Blocks and Sections

If you’re going to extract until you can’t extract anymore, that means each block and section of code needs to be broken into small, expressively named functions.

## Conclusion
To sum it up—functions should be small. No, that’s not an echo, we really said it again.

If you’re going to be successful in writing small functions, you need to be comfortable with extracting and only stopping when there’s nothing left to extract. There are two ways to verify that you’ve extracted as much as possible:

1. Your function does only one thing; and
2. Your function is on one level of abstraction

This is the hardest part of keeping your code clean, so don’t get discouraged if it takes extra effort in the beginning. Writing clean code is a skill and creating and strengthening a skill takes practice. Focus on making continuous improvements and remember that the end-goal is code that can be read quickly and easily.
