There are four general guidelines for clean error handling that should always be implemented.
1. Find the root of the error
2. Include relevant error details
3. Handle errors properly
4. use exception instead of codes 

## Returning Error Codes vs Throwing Exceptions
As you read above, exceptions are preferred over error codes because they keep your code clean and maintainable. The following example demonstrates this point by using both methods on a single piece of code.

## Try-Catch-Finally Statements

“Try-catch-finally statements” are an important part of keeping code clean. They allow an execution to terminate at any point and then continue at the “catch.”

## Don’t Return Nulls

## Don’t Pass Nulls
