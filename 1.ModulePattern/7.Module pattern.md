The idea behind a module in JavaScript is that you want to write code that doesn’t leak into other parts of your codebase — specifically, you want to avoid writing code that’s globally scoped. This is so important because if you’re writing a web application, you’ll soon realize that all the scripts you include are all part of the same global scope, which means that it’s really easy to have variable name clashes!

So what exactly is the module pattern? The idea behind the module pattern is to use a construct that allows you to write private, localized code so that you minimize the amount of code that gets leaked into the global scope.

Let’s take a look at how we would build up to the Module Pattern in JavaScript, starting off with creating an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) and assigning the result to a variable:

```js
var yourModule = (function () {
  // This is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
  // More JavaScript code in here
})();
```

```js
var yourModule = (function () {
  var arrayOfData = [ 'javascript', 'is' ];
  var privateFunction = function (array) {
    return array.concat( 'awesome' );
  };
  var yourPublicFunction = function () {
    var result = privateFunction(arrayOfData);
    return result.join(' ');
  };
  return {
    yourPublicFunction: yourPublicFunction
  };
})();
```

The main idea is to encapsulate all function and object definitions within an immediately invoked function expression and then decide what to expose via the IIFE’s return value. Instead of defining all those same functions and objects in the global scope, you’ve now kept them modularized within this pattern and minimized the number of variables declared in the global scope to just your module!
