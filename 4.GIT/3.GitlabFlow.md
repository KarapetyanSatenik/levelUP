## GitLab Flow

With GitFlow, developers create a develop branch and make that the default while GitLab Flow works with the main branch right away.
GitLab Flow is great when you want to maintain multiple environments and when you prefer to have a staging environment separate from the production environment. Then, whenever the main branch is ready to be deployed, you can merge back into the production branch and release it.

While GitHub Flow assumes that you can deploy into production whenever you merge a feature branch into the master, GitLab Flow seeks to resolve that issue by allowing the code to pass through internal environments before it reaches production.
this method is suited for situations where you donâ€™t control the timing of the release, such as an iOS app that needs to go through the App store validation first or when you have specific deployment windows.
