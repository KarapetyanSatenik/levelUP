## Node.js

- node.js is open source and its source code is publicly available for sharing and modification
- node.js is cross-platform and available on Mac, Windows and Linux
- It's a JavaScript runtime environment which provides all the necessary components in order to use and run a JavaScript program outside the browser
- It can execute not only the standard ecmascript language but also new features that are made available through C++ bindings using the V8 engine
- Without V8 there is no way for node.js to understand the JavaScript code we write
- JavaScript as a language was not designed to deal with low level functionality like file system or networking, C plus plus on the other hand was designed to do that

How does a JavaScript developer get access to these C++ features? Should they know C++?
Well, the answer is that the lib folder contains JavaScript code that's been written for you to easily get access to the C++ features, for example fs.js contains JavaScript code that we can write to access the file system.
The code internally calls the corresponding C++ feature which further relies on libuv to access the OS.

## Key differences with Browser

In the browser most of the time what we are doing is interacting with the Dom or other web platform apis like cookies, now those do not exist in node.js, we don't have the document window and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.

Similarly in the browser we don't have all the nice apis that node.js provides through its modules for example the file system access functionality.

With node.js you can control the environment, which version of node.js you want to have.
Compare this with the browser where we are at the mercy of what the user chooses.
