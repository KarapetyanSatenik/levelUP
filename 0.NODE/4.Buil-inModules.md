## Built-in Modules

- Modules that node.js ships with
- Also referred to as core modules
- Import the module before you can use it

1. path, events, fs, stream, http

## Events
The events module is a built-in module that allows us to work with events in node. In case ov events they will occur when we call the event.
The module returns an event emitter class which we can instantiate to create an emitter object.

```js
const EventEmitter = require("events");

class PizzaShop extends EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.orderNumber = 0;
  }

  order(size, topping) {
    this.orderNumber++;
    this.emit("order", size, topping);
  }

  displayOrderNumber() {
    console.log(`Current order number: ${this.orderNumber}`);
  }
}

class DrinkMachine {
  serveDrink(size) {
    if (size === "large") {
      console.log("Serving complimentary drink");
    }
  }
}

const pizzaShop = new PizzaShop();
const drinkMachine = new DrinkMachine();

pizzaShop.on("order", (size, topping) => {
  console.log(`Order received! Baking a ${size} pizza with ${topping}`);
  drinkMachine.serveDrink(size);
});

pizzaShop.order("large", "mushrooms");
```

Examples such as pizzaShop can extend from event emitter allowing them to Emit and react to their own custom events and the reason I want you to remember this is because most of the built-in modules especially FS, streams and HTTP extend from the event emitter class.


## Character Sets and Encoding
- Computers store and represent data in binary format which is a collection of zeros and ones.
- Each 0 or 1 is called a binary digit or bit for short.
- To work with a piece of data a computer needs to convert the data into its binary representation.

## Streams

Streams are collections of data — just like arrays or strings. The difference is that streams might not be available all at once, and they don’t have to fit in memory. This makes streams really powerful when working with large amounts of data, or data that’s coming from an external source one chunk at a time.

- stream is a sequence of data that is being moved from one point to another, 
1. for example a stream of data over the Internet being moved from one computer to another 
1. for example a stream of data being transferred from one file to another within the same computer

- process streams of data in chunks as they arrive instead of waiting for the entire data to be available before processing.
- if you're transferring file contents from file A to file B, you don't have to wait for entire fileA contents to be saved in temporary memory before moving it into fileB

```js
const fs = require("fs");

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("./file.txt", {
  encoding: "utf8",
  highWaterMark: 2,
});

const writeableStream = fs.createWriteStream("./file2.txt");

readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(chunk);
  writeableStream.write(chunk);
});

// 2

readableStream.pipe(writeableStream);

```

## FS

```js
fs.writeFile(
  "./greet.txt",
  " Hello Vishwas",
  {
    flag: "a", // for appending
  },
  (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      console.log("File written");
    }
  }
);

// 2

const fs = require("node:fs/promises");

fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8")
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));

// 3

const fs = require("node:fs/promises");

async function readFile() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8");
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

readFile();
```


### HTTP

HTTP module also extends the event emitter class and the callback function we have specified here is actually a request listener that is whenever a request reaches the server, this callback function is executed.

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
  res.end("Hello world!");
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

server.listen(PORT, () => console.log("Server is running on port 3000")); //you can also specify a callback function for when the server starts to listen

```

```js
// HTML response

const http = require("node:http");
const fs = require("node:fs");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
  fs.createReadStream(__dirname + "/index.html").pipe(res);
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});

```


```js

// JSON response

const http = require("node:http");
const fs = require("node:fs");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
  const superHero = {
    firstName: "Bruce",
    lastName: "Wayne",
  };
  res.end(superHero);
   
});
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});

```

## readLine

```js
const readline = require('readline');
const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});
rl.question('Write path which do you want to read ', (param) => {
   console.log(param);
   rl.close();
});

```
