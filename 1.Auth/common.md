## Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity. It ensures that the entity claiming a particular identity is indeed who they say they are. Authentication involves providing credentials, such as a username and password, a security token, a fingerprint scan, or any other form of identification. The goal of authentication is to establish trust and allow only authorized users to access a system or resource.

## Authorization:
Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. Once a user's identity is verified through authentication, authorization comes into play to control what that user can do within the system. Authorization involves defining access control rules, such as what actions (read, write, delete, etc.) a user is allowed to perform on specific resources.

In simpler terms: 

- Authentication answers the question, "Who are you?"
- Authorization answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

Together, these concepts ensure that only legitimate users gain access to resources they are entitled to use, enhancing security and privacy within a system.

Authentication can be done in several ways, including:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Password-based authentication
- Token-based authentication
- Single sign-on (SSO)

Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Permission-based access control
- Access control lists (ACLs)
