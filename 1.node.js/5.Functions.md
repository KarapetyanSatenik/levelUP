A function passed as an argument to another function is called a callback function.

We can categorize callbacks into two synchronous and asynchronous.

1. synchronous callbacks a callback which is executed immediately is called a synchronous callback.

2. Async callback is a callback that is often used to continue or resume code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed. So in the async world callbacks are used to delay the execution of a function until a particular time or event has occurred. 
For example addEventListener it does not immediately run the callback function, the function is only run when the user clicks on the button, in other words the execution of the Callback function is delayed till an event occurs in the browser and that event is the click event.
