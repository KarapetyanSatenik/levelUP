# YAGNI Principle

YAGNI stands for You Ain’t Gonna Need It. It’s a principle from software development methodology of Extreme Programming (XP). This principle says that you should not create features that it’s not really necessary.

This principle it’s similar to the KISS principle, once that both of them aim for a simpler solution. The difference between them it’s that YAGNI focus on removing unnecessary functionality and logic, and KISS focus on the complexity.

Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.

It means that you should not implement functionality just because you think that you may need it someday, but implement it just when you really need it. Doing that you will avoid spending time with implementations that were not even necessary, and maybe will never be used.
