No matter which other practices are in your style guide or what modern JavaScript features you may be using, your first step when writing code should be to ensure that you're working in strict mode. 

Indicating that code should be interpreted in strict mode specifies to user agents like browsers that they should treat code literally as written and throw an error if the code doesn't make sense. Without strict mode turned on. user agents often go through a series of modifications to problematic code in an attempt to get it to make sense.
