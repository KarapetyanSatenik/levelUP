### Core Kanban Principles
Kanban is a very popular framework for development in the agile software development methodology. It provides a transparent way of visualizing the tasks and work capacity of a team. It mainly uses physical and digital boards to allow the team members to visualize the current state of the project they are working on.

- Kanban should be used when you want to release your work at any time. It requires git branching
- It should be used when you want to visualize your work, and you want to see the progress of your tasks visually.

- Kanban is based on these six principles

1. Vizualise the workflow (Without understanding what happens, it is hard to implement change)
2. Limit work in progress (Implement a pull system, typically a kanban system)
3. Manage flow (monitor and measure how work flows through the system, in order to detect problems and opportunities for improvement)
4. Make policies explicit (Document how the system works, thereby creating a common basis for understanding and improvement)
5. Implement feedback loops (Regular collaboration and review at team and company level is important to facilitate continuous improvement)
6. Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally (Involve and inspire everyone to suggest improvements, and experiment to validate theories)

In Scrum we divide our work into sprints.

In Kanban Method, we don’t divide the work into periods, we have a continuous delivery flow system and limit the work in progress, to achieve higher speed and better focus.

with Kanban, you don’t do estimates or story points.

## Delegation

delegation occurs when a manager assigns specific tasks to their employees.

## SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
Planning, Requirement Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance
Precoding 
Definition of Ready - Ready for going to Sprint
Definition of Done – Ready for going to production
Coding 
Follow the same coding standards
Code review
Technical debt - implement code in a non-optimal way


## Code Quality
Code quality – simple and clean, easy to read, change and maintain. extensible
