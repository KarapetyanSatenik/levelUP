SCRUM is an agile development method which concentrates specifically on how to manage tasks within a team-based development environment. Agile and Scrum consist of three roles, and their responsibilities are explained as follows:

Scrum Master Scrum Master is responsible for setting up the team, sprint meeting and removes obstacles to progress
Product owner The Product Owner creates product backlog, prioritizes the backlog and is responsible for the delivery of the functionality at each iteration
Scrum Team Team manages its own work and organizes the work to complete the sprint or cycle

Process flow of Scrum Methodologies:

1. Each iteration of a scrum is known as Sprint
2. Product backlog is a list where all details are entered to get the end-product
3. During each Sprint, top user stories of Product backlog are selected and turned into Sprint backlog
4. Team works on the defined sprint backlog
5. Team checks for the daily work
6. At the end of the sprint, team delivers product functionality


Organizations apply Scrum through a series of specific events (or meetings). Among them are:
1. Sprint Planning,
2. Daily Scrum,
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective.
