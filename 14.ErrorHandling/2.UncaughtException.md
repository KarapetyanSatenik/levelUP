# Uncaught Exception

Uncaught Exception is when you throw an error and did not catch anywhere.
## Creating exceptions

An exception is created using the throw keyword:
```js
throw value;
```
Usually in client-side code value can be any JavaScript value including a string, a number or an object.

In Node.js, we don't throw strings, we just throw Error objects.

## Handling exceptions

An exception handler is a try/catch statement.

Any exception raised in the lines of code included in the try block is handled in the corresponding catch block:

```js
try {
  // lines of code
} catch (e) {}
```

## Catching uncaught exceptions

If an uncaught exception gets thrown during the execution of your program, your program will crash.

To solve this, you listen for the uncaughtException event on the process object:

```js
process.on('uncaughtException', err => {
  console.error('There was an uncaught error', err);
  process.exit(1); // mandatory (as per the Node.js docs)
});
```
You don't need to import the process core module for this, as it's automatically injected.
