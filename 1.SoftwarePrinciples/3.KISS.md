# KISS Principle

KISS is an acronym for Keep It Simple, Stupid. This principle says about to make your code simple. You should avoid unnecessary complexity. A simple code it’s easier to maintain and easier to understand.

You can apply this principle in the design and in the implementation of the code. You should eliminate duplicated code, should remove unnecessary features, don’t use unnecessary variables and methods, use names for variables and methods that makes sense and matches their responsibilities, and always when it’s possible, follow know standards of code development. You also should separate the responsibilities of your classes and the responsibilities from the layers of the project.

Sometimes you don’t need to implement something new to attend your needs, you can simply make use of the features of the programming language that you are using. For that, it’s good that you know the features of the programming language that you are working with.

If you are working in a code that it’s already implemented, and you see something that it’s not necessary or could be simpler, you should consider refactoring it.

```js
nterface Country {
  code: string;
  discountAmountPercent: number;
  taxAmountPercent: number;
  discountRegions: Array<string>;
}

class Poland implements Country {
    code: string = "pl_PL";
    discountAmountPercent: number = 15;
    taxAmountPercent: number = 23;
    discountRegions: Array<string> = [
      "masovia",
      "lubusz"
    ];
}

class Payment {

     setTax(price: any, tax: number) {
       return (price + (tax/100*price));
     }

     setDiscount(price: any, discount: number) {
       return (price - ((discount/100)*price));
     }

     pay(country: Country, region: string, amount: number, nettoPrice: number) {

       if (
         country.discountRegions.indexOf(region.toLowerCase()) != -1
         && amount > 15
       ) {
         nettoPrice = this.setDiscount(nettoPrice, country.discountAmountPercent);
       }

       const bruttoPrice = this.setTax(nettoPrice, country.taxAmountPercent);
       return (bruttoPrice*amount);
     }
}

const payment = new Payment();
console.log ( payment.pay((new Poland), 'masovia', 25, 1000) );
