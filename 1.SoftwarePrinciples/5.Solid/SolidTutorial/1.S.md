## Single Responsibility 

The Single Responsibility Principle says a class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and the responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
A common paraphrase of this is, a class should have one and only one reason to change. 

What does single mean? This question is really about finding the right level of abstraction. The goal is to have a class which can be summarized with a succinct responsibility statement.
The statement distinguishes one class from all the other classes in the application. Membership in the class is unambiguous.

What is a responsibility? It can help to take some hints from the General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles, GRASP
- The GRASP patterns provide a set of concepts that can be used to sort out relationships among classes. 

If a Class has many responsibilities, it increases the possibility of bugs because making changes to one of its responsibilities, could affect the other ones without you knowing.

- Goal

This principle aims to separate behaviors so that if bugs arise as a result of your change, it wonâ€™t affect other unrelated behaviors.
