## Single Responsibility 

The Single Responsibility Principle says a class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and the responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
A common paraphrase of this is, a class should have one and only one reason to change. 

What does single mean? This question is really about finding the right level of abstraction. The goal is to have a class which can be summarized with a succinct responsibility statement.
The statement distinguishes one class from all the other classes in the application. Membership in the class is unambiguous.

What is a responsibility? It can help to take some hints from the General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles, GRASP
- The GRASP patterns provide a set of concepts that can be used to sort out relationships among classes. 

If a Class has many responsibilities, it increases the possibility of bugs because making changes to one of its responsibilities, could affect the other ones without you knowing.

- Goal

This principle aims to separate behaviors so that if bugs arise as a result of your change, it won’t affect other unrelated behaviors.

```js
// Single Responsibility Principle
// Принцип единственной ответственности
const http = {send: () => ({})};

const generateId = () => Date.now() * Math.random();

class User {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  password: string;

  constructor(username: string, password: string) {
    this.id = generateId();
    this.username = username;
    this.password = password;
  }
}

class UserRepository {
  save(user: User) {
    // сохранение пользователя в бд
  }
}

class UserLogger {
  log(user: User) {
    console.log(user)
  }
}

class UserController {
  send(user: User) {
    return http.send()
  }
}
```
