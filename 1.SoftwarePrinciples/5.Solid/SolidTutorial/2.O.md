### O  Open-Closed
This principle suggests that Software entities(classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification”. 
The open/closed principle summarizes the goals of the interface segregation principle and the Liskov Substitution principle.
A design with good interface segregation and Liskov Substitution applied, tends to have classes which can be ended by creating subclasses. There's no need to modify classes to add new features.

What is means is that if the class A is written by the developer AA, and if the developer BB wants some modification on that then developer BB should be easily do that by extending class A, but not by modifying class A.

The easy example would be the RecyclerView.Adapter class. Developers can easily extend this class and create their own custom adapter with custom behavior without modifying the existing RecyclerView.Adapter class.

Changing the current behavior of a Class will affect all the systems using that Class.

If you want the Class to perform more functions, the ideal approach is to add to the functions that already exist NOT change them.

- Goal

This principle aims to extend a Class’s behavior without changing the existing behavior of that Class(which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it). This is to avoid causing bugs wherever the Class is being used.
