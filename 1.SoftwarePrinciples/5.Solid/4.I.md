## Interface Segregation Principle

This principle is formulated by Robert Martin in 1996. It basically says that clients should not be dependent on using interfaces they do not use. It aims to get rid of dirty interfaces and contain high cohesion.

Clients should only see the methods they will use, and subclasses should inherit only the methods they need. Otherwise, structures must be dismantled, avoid fat classes.

So, we have a fridge class, it freezes, cools and sends data via IOT system. We have a new product and we have set it as our main product in marketing. The new product has these 3 features, freezer, cooler and IOT. We also have an old refrigerator in the market, but it does not have IOT technology. So, we have to override the iot method in a way that generates error. This means that, if PrevProduct class was requested to be used in another place, it would appear that the IOT feature (method) is available, but an error will be received when someone tried to use it. This is against the Interface Segregation Principle.

What we can do is create abstract classes for freezing, cooling, and iot features.

Then we inherit only what we need for each product. Thus, we did not inherit the unused feature (method) in the old product.
