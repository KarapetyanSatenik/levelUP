Shopify is a Software as a Service (SaaS) e-commerce platform that enables individuals and businesses to create and run their own online stores.
It is ideal if you don't want to worry about technology, and instead, you want to focus on the products that you're selling and how you're selling them
It provides all the tools and features needed to set up and manage an online store without needing to know complicated technical stuff.
The platform simplifies complex tasks, allowing developers to focus on customizations.
It provides a range of customization options, including themes, templates, and plugins.


## Hoisting

Shopify is a hosted platform, which means developers have limited control over the hosting environment. This might be a drawback for those who prefer more control over server configurations.
While Shopify offers various pricing plans, some plans include transaction fees on top of credit card fees. 

## Backend architecture
Shopify uses a cloud-based architecture, where the core functionality of the platform is hosted on Shopify's servers. It employs a combination of Ruby on Rails for backend development and JavaScript for frontend interactions.

## API
As a backend developer, your role is to interact with these backend servers via APIs to extend and customize the platform's functionality
Backend code handles tasks like data processing, external integrations, and complex logic.
The Shopify API is RESTful, which means it uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.
It's a collection of endpoints (URLs) that allow you to access and manipulate data within a store.


## Types of Themes

Shopify offers three types of themes: Free themes, Paid themes, and Custom themes. Free themes are provided by Shopify and can be customized to some extent. Paid themes are developed by third-party designers and offer more advanced features and customization options. Custom themes are entirely tailored to the specific needs of a store and are built from scratch by developers.
Think of themes like the outside of the car. You can change the colors, you can add a spoiler to the back and you can tint the windows. All of these make your car look really cool but they don't affect the performance of the car. The same thing is true with themes.


## Customizing Store Design
Shopify allows users to customize store design through its theme editor. Users can modify colors, fonts, layout, and add custom CSS/HTML code to personalize the look and feel of their store.

## Scalability
Whether you're building a small online store or a large-scale e-commerce platform, Shopify is designed to scale. Its cloud-based architecture ensures that your solution can handle increased traffic and demand without compromising on performance or user experience.

## Security and Compliance
Shopify takes security seriously. It provides robust security measures, including SSL encryption, regular security updates, and compliance with industry standards such as PCI DSS. This is crucial for protecting customer data and maintaining trust.

## API and Customization
Shopify offers extensive APIs (REST and GraphQL) that allow developers to build custom apps, integrations, and features tailored to specific business needs. This flexibility enables developers to create truly unique and differentiated solutions.

## Webhooks 
Webhooks, which allow you to receive real-time notifications of events happening in a Shopify store.
They allow Shopify to notify your app when specific events occur, such as when an order is placed, a product is updated, or a customer is created.
Webhooks are HTTP callbacks, where Shopify sends POST requests to a specified URL
To receive webhook notifications, you must register webhook subscriptions for specific events in your app.
Each webhook subscription includes the event, the URL of your endpoint, and the webhook's unique identifier.


## Understanding OAuth2 in Shopify
OAuth2 is the standard protocol used for securing interactions between your app and Shopify. It allows your app to request authorization to access a store's data on behalf of the store owner.


## Liquid
theme templating language is liquid

## App marketplace
Shopify also has an app marketplace where they have thousands of apps.
