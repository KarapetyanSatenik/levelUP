## Modules

Modules allow you to divide the codebase into small units that can be developed and tested independently. Modules are also the main mechanism to enforce information hiding by keeping private all the functions and variables that are not explicitly marked to be exported.

- In node.js each file is a module but is isolated by default. And each module is wrapped in an IIFE and has a private scope.
- It's always good to split your JavaScript programs into separate modules that can be imported when needed, that allows you to easily manage the code as your application grows.

In total we have three different types of modules 

1. local modules - modules that we create in our application 
2. built-in modules - modules that node ships with out of the box 
3. third-party modules - modules written by other developers that we can use in our application

- Node.js currently comes with two different module systems: CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript modules (ESM or ES modules).
