## import/export vs require()

Modules allow you to divide the codebase into small units that can be developed and tested independently. Modules are also the main mechanism to enforce information hiding by keeping private all the functions and variables that are not explicitly marked to be exported.

Node.js currently comes with two different module systems: CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript modules (ESM or ES modules).

# Module System

In 2015, with the release of ECMAScript 6, we had opportunity of ESM or ECMAScript modules.
ESM brings a lot of innovation to the JavaScript ecosystem and, among other things, it tries to bridge the gap between how modules are managed on browsers and servers.

## CommonJS modules

CommonJS is the first module system originally built into Node.js. Node.jsâ€™ CommonJS implementation respects the CommonJS specification, with the addition of some custom extensions.

The two main concepts of the CommonJS specification:

- require is a function that allows you to import a module from the local filesystem.
- exports and module.exports are special variables that can be used to export public functionality from the current module. The exports variable is just a reference to the initial value of module.exports.

- In CommonJS, modules are loaded synchronously and processed in the order the JavaScript runtime finds them. This system was born with server-side JavaScript in mind and is not suitable for the client-side. This is why ES Modules were introduced.
