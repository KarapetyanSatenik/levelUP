## Module System

In 2015, with the release of ECMAScript 6, we had opportunity of ESM or ECMAScript modules.
ESM brings a lot of innovation to the JavaScript ecosystem and, among other things, it tries to bridge the gap between how modules are managed on browsers and servers.

In ESM files are loaded asynchronously.

```js
// a.mjs
console.log(45);
import { obj } from "./b.mjs";
console.log(obj);

// b.mjs

console.log(1);
export const obj = {
  name: "John",
};
console.log(12);
```
