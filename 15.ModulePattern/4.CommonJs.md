## CommonJS modules

CommonJS is the first module system originally built into Node.js. Node.jsâ€™ CommonJS implementation respects the CommonJS specification, with the addition of some custom extensions.

The two main concepts of the CommonJS specification:

- require is a function that allows you to import a module from the local filesystem.
- exports and module.exports are special variables that can be used to export public functionality from the current module. The exports variable is just a reference to the initial value of module.exports.

- In CommonJS, modules are loaded synchronously and processed in the order the JavaScript runtime finds them. This system was born with server-side JavaScript in mind and is not suitable for the client-side. This is why ES Modules were introduced.


- Common.js is a standard that states how a module should be structured and shared.
- Node.js adopted common.js when it started out and is what you will see in code bases.
- To load a module into another file we use the require function.
- When index.js is executed the code in the module is also executed
```js
// add.js
console.log(34)

// index.js
require(".add")
console.log(12)
// 34 12
```

In Common.js
- Each file is treated as a Module.
- Variables, functions, classes are not accessible to other files by default.
- Explicitly tell the module system which parts of your code should be exported via module.exports or exports.
- To import code into a file use the require function
