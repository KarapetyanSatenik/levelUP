In total we have three different types of modules 

1. local modules - modules that we create in our application 
2. built-in modules - modules that node ships with out of the box 
3. third-party modules - modules written by other developers that we can use in our application

It's always good to split your JavaScript programs into separate modules that can be imported when needed, that allows you to easily manage the code as your application grows.

In node.js each file is a module but is isolated by default.

### Common js

- Common.js is a standard that states how a module should be structured and shared.
- Node.js adopted common.js when it started out and is what you will see in code bases.
- To load a module into another file we use the require function.
- When index.js is executed the code in the module is also executed
```js
// add.js
console.log(34)

// index.js
require(".add")
console.log(12)
// 34 12
```
