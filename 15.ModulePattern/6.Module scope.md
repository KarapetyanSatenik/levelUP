# Module scope

Before modules, a variable declared outside any function was a global variable. In modules, a variable declared outside any function is hidden and not available to other modules unless it is explicitly exported.

Exporting makes a function or object available to other modules. In the next example, I export a function from the sequence.js module file:

```js
// in sequence.js
export { sequence, toList, take };

```

Importing makes a function or object, from other modules, available to the current module.

```js
import { sequence, toList, toList } from "./sequence";
```

In a way, we can imagine a module as a self-executing function that takes the import data as inputs and returns the export data.
