# Module scope

Each module in node.js has its own scope and the way node.js achieves that is with the IIFE pattern in JavaScript.
Before a modules code is executed node.js will wrap it with a function wrapper that provides module scope.
This allows you to repeat variable or function names without any conflicts.
So modules don't have access to each others variables, but there are few global variables which is available for use in every module` exports, require, fileName, dirName, module.

Before modules, a variable declared outside any function was a global variable. In modules, a variable declared outside any function is hidden and not available to other modules unless it is explicitly exported.

Exporting makes a function or object available to other modules. In the next example, I export a function from the sequence.js module file:

```js
// in sequence.js
export { sequence, toList, take };

```

Importing makes a function or object, from other modules, available to the current module.

```js
import { sequence, toList, toList } from "./sequence";
```

In a way, we can imagine a module as a self-executing function that takes the import data as inputs and returns the export data.
