## Asynchronous JS
JavaScript has no idea what the World Wide Web or Internet is, it's single threaded. It's a programming language.
On the other hand, the web browser or node JS allows us to use async or asynchronous code so we can interact with things outside the world of JavaScript.

Asynchronous functions are functions that we can execute later.
Once our JavaScript engine sees something that is asynchronous or something like timeout, that is part of a web API, We send it over to the Web API and then the Web API is going to do something for us in the background.
And when it's done with whatever it is, such as a timeout or 5 seconds, it will add the callback or the function that we need to invoke into the callback queue.
And then the event loop is going to check and see if our call stack is empty and then if it's empty, it pops it onto the call stack.

So the event loop simply monitors the call stack and the callback queue.
