Well, inheritance is an object getting access to the properties and methods of another object.
Cuz everything is an object in JS through chaining that we call prototypical inheritance functions get access to the methods and properties of objects.

Global Object is the object that everything in JavaScript gets created from.
An object gets access to the properties and methods of another object through the prototype chain.

As a matter of fact, this feature is actually quite unique and not that common in other popular languages like C# or Java, they use something called classical inheritance.

There's actually no classes in JavaScript. There are syntax sugar. We only have prototype inheritance.

if the JavaScript engine doesn't find the property on that object, it goes up the prototype chain.

functions have __proto__, prototype, name properties.
Proto ALWAYS points to prototype.
Only functions have prototype property.
