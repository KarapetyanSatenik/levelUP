When function finishes its works it gets popped off the stack.
So what happens when things get popped off the stack?
Well, we remove the variable environment.

And the heap just gets cleaned up by the garbage collection.
So why can we use closures? Again, that's because of 
We can have functions that return functions, functions as first class citizens, and we have this idea of lexical scope where we write the function matters, not where we call the function or where we invoke the function.

```js
const foo = (str) => (number) => (boolean)=> console.log(str, number, boolean);
```

Parameters are treated just like local variables that gets stored in variable environments.

```js
function callMe(){
    setTimeout(()=>{
        console.log(mother);
    })
    const mother = "Syuzanna"
}
```

It doesn't matter where we define this variable. Even if it's const, We don't care about hoisting here.
Instead, this piece of code(cb of setTimeout) goes all the way into web API world gets put on the callback queue. The Event Loop pushes it back onto the stack, but by that time we already ran this outer callMe function.
const call me, has already been created and assigned and because it sees that there's an enclosing
function that is using it, it's going to create a closure.

Closures allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or outer scope environment, even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.
