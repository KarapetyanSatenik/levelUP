Classical inheritance is limited to classes inheriting from other classes. However prototypal inheritance includes not only prototypes inheriting from other prototypes but also objects inheriting from prototypes. 
 When we read a property from object, and it’s missing, JavaScript automatically 
 takes it from the prototype. In programming, this is called “prototypal inheritance”.
