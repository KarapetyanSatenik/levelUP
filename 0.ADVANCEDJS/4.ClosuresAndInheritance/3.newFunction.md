### new Function 

Usually, a function remembers where it was born in the special property [[Environment]]. It references the Lexical Environment from where it’s created.
But when a function is created using new Function, its [[Environment]] is set to reference not the current Lexical Environment, but the global one.

So, such function doesn’t have access to outer variables, only to the global ones.

```js
function getFunc() {
  let value = "test";

  let func = new Function('alert(value)');

  return func;
}

getFunc()(); // error: value is not defined
```


This special feature of new Function looks strange, but appears very useful in practice.

Imagine that we must create a function from a string. The code of that function is not known at the time of writing the script (that’s why we don’t use regular functions), but will be known in the process of execution. We may receive it from the server or from another source.

Our new function needs to interact with the main script.

What if it could access the outer variables?

Besides, such code would be architecturally bad and prone to errors.
