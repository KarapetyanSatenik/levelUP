1. Variables

Variables declared with var become properties of global object(window), but let and const don't become properties of window object.
Variables with let and const are hoisted and stored in temporary dead zone(in browser debugger known as script) but they are not initialized, they're not accessible rather than it is defined. In execution phase they will be initialized with the value of undefined or assigned value at once.

```js
var a = 12 // configurable true
b = 13 // configurable false
```

During creation or compilation phase when JS engine sees variable declared with var keyword second time, It will ignore it and skip. 

```js
var age = 12
var age = 6
```
