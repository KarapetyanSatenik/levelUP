Scheme was a programming language that was created at MIT in the seventies. It was a very unique programming language and I believe the first language to have closures in the program.
Brendan Eich really liked the functional side of scheme, this idea of closures and functions as first class citizens.
But at the same time he also had pressure from the Java community where classes and classical inheritance was really, really important.
So based on the roots of JavaScript, which were inspired by scheme and Java, we have this multi paradigm language.
Unlike a lot of languages, you can mix and match these paradigms and you can't really say that JavaScript is an object oriented programming language or a functional language.
