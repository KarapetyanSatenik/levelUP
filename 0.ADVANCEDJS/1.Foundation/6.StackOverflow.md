What happens if we keep calling functions nested inside of each other over and over and over?

if you call function on line ten, then line 11, then line 13, this stack is going to get pushed on and then popped off, pushed on and then popped off.

But what if we have functions that are nested inside of each other so that we keep growing this stack until it gets larger and larger.
Until we can't do it anymore.
Well, that's called Stack Overflow.

Recursion is one of the most common ways to create a StackOverflow or a lot of functions nested inside of each other, to create that stack that keeps growing and growing.

If we run this code
```js
function increase(){
    increase()
}
```
we will get an error - maximum called stack size exceed it.

But in order to prevent the browser from crashing, if it reaches a limit, it's going to print out this error(maximum called stack size exceed it) saying, Hey, you've just created a Stack Overflow.
