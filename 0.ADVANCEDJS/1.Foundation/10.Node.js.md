By now you should have a good understanding of the difference between a JavaScript engine and a JavaScript runtime.

1. You see, a JavaScript file is kind of like musical notes. Ways for us to write music, write programs.

2. The JavaScript engine is kind of like the musician or the composer. That person that can read this music and understand it and make sense of it.

3. And then the runtime is kind of like the whole package where we have the musician.

But we also give that musician, besides the musical notes, all these tools to play our beautiful music.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime.
So he created Node.js, which is actually a C++ program.You can actually think of it as Node.exe. A C++ program that provides this runtime for us.

There's no window like we had in the browser. Instead, node has something called global and that's its global API.
Just like we had with Window, in Node we have this global API that we can use, which also happens to have setTimeout setInterval.
That's nice, but also has some extra things that we couldn't do in a browser.
And that is why Node is set to be a server side platform based on asynchronous IO that is non blocking.
