Function Name Scope
In the "Function Name Scope" section in Chapter 3, I asserted that the name of a function expression is added to the function's own scope. Recall:
```js
var askQuestion = function ofTheTeacher(){
    // ..
};
```
It's true that ofTheTeacher is not added to the enclosing scope (where askQuestion is declared), but it's also not just added to the scope of the function, the way you're likely assuming. It's another strange corner case of implied scope.

The name identifier of a function expression is in its own implied scope, nested between the outer enclosing scope and the main inner function scope.

If ofTheTeacher was in the function's scope, we'd expect an error here:
```js
var askQuestion = function ofTheTeacher(){
    // why is this not a duplicate declaration error?
    let ofTheTeacher = "Confused, yet?";
};
```
The let declaration form does not allow re-declaration (see Chapter 5). But this is perfectly legal shadowing, not re-declaration, because the two ofTheTeacher identifiers are in separate scopes.

You'll rarely run into any case where the scope of a function's name identifier matters. But again, it's good to know how these mechanisms actually work. To avoid being bitten, never shadow function name identifiers.
