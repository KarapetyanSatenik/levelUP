### Scope and Context

Scope is a function based thing, scope means what is the variable access of a function when it is invoked?
Context, on the other hand, is more about object based.
Context says what's the value of the this keyword, which is a reference to the object that owns that current executing code.
Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked with the value of this keyword and scope refers to the visibility of variables.

JavaScript engine before we run any code, before we get to line 12 or line 13 already knows which function has access to which variables.
Parameters are treated just like local variables that gets stored in variable environments.
