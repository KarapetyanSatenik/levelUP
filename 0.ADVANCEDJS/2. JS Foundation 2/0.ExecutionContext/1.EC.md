## EC
When you run any JS, a special environment is created to handles the transformation and the execution of that code and this is called the execution context. It's going to contain the currently running code and everything that aids in its execution. 
EC is created when we run our script.
whenever an execution context is created, there's two phases that happen. Memory creation phase, execution phase.

1. Memory creation phase

- create the global object(browser=window, Node.js=global)
- Create the this object and bind it to the global object
- Setup memory for storing variables and function references
- Store entire functions (with its body, but not for all the case) and variables in lex env and set to undefined
so the entire function is in memory before the script is actually executed

2. Execution phase

- Execute code line by line
- Create a new execution context for each function call

in creation phase all the code will be scanned and put the memory, and in execution phase the code will be executed. 

Also when we call function is created function execution context, which also has creation and execution phase.
In creation phase will scan and will put variables in memory or lex env.
