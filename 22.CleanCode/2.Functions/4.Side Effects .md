Along with carefully using parameters when writing functions, it is important to be cautious when using side effects. A side effect within a function can cause confusion and significantly reduce the readability of your code.

A function has a side effect when calling that function results in an external state change. A single, pesky side effect can make your function return a different result each time it’s called. It can also cause another, separate function to return a different result—even if that function doesn’t have a side effect.

Side effects aren’t all bad, though. They can serve an important purpose in your code. Without side effects, your code wouldn’t be able to make changes to databases or write to external files. The key is to use side effects only when they are necessary and eliminate them elsewhere.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, side effects are a necessary, slightly confusing, part of programming. They can make things complicated, but they are the only way to make changes to objects outside of our code—which is critical.

It is a best practice to minimize the use of side effects as much as possible. When you have no choice but to use a side effect, you can utilize the block passing technique to minimize the disruption and maintain the readability of your code.
