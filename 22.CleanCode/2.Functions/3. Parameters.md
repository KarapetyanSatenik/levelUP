## Parameters

Parameters are a sticky subject. They are a necessary part of coding but oftentimes decrease the readability of your code. The more parameters there are on a single function, the more difficult it is to read. For this reason, it is important to reduce the number of parameters on functions and even eliminate them altogether when possible.

## The “Golden Number”

We have to say this one more time—the ideal number of parameters is zero.

When that’s not possible, it’s important to limit your parameters to a reasonable number because a function with too many parameters is unreadable.

The “golden number” is between zero and two parameters. There are rare cases when you may need three, but that should not be the norm. Regardless of whether your function has zero or three parameters, it is your responsibility to make sure the code can be read quickly and easily by other developers.
