- closure has been added in ES3 in 1999
- public class has been added in ES4 bur for political reason it died
- we also have E4X. In E4X we could put xml in JS, and it was precursor to the idea of JSX. This also died.
- in 2009 we have es5 after 10 years ago. We got strict mood, 
that was the huge change set all of these changes that actually had been building up since es4 finally landed all at once and this one giant change set so this was definitely not a baby step but it was comprised of a bunch of ideas that had been baby steps along the way.
- ES6 are often called es2015 because technically very late in the game the tc39 committee decided to rename it from es6 to es 2015.

The next is ES 2016 many people called that es7 and you're also bad for calling it
es7 because it's called es 2016 that is the official name for the language, So don't call it es7 call it es 2016.
ES 2017- Async Await
