- JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single threaded language.
- To make async programming possible we need the help of Libuv.

We have the V8 engine which executes JavaScript code. It comprises memory heap and call stack.

Libuv will then run the task using native async mechanisms of the operating system and if that is not possible, it will utilize its thread pool to run the task ensuring the main thread is not blocked. 
the main thread of execution always starts in the global scope so the global function is pushed onto the stack and if there is no more code to execute, global function is also popped off from stack.


Read file is an async operation that is offloaded to libue, so what happens now is that the Callback function of readFile is handed over to libue JavaScript then simply pops off the readFile method from the call stack because its job is done.

In the background the Libuv starts to read the file contents on a separate thread.
When callBack will be ready due to Event Loop it will be pushed onto call stack and will be executed.
All phases are  part of libuv, but the two microtasks however are not part of libuv.

First you should know that all user written synchronous JavaScript code takes priority over asynchronous code that the runtime would like to execute. Which means only after the call stack is empty the event Loop comes into picture.
Before event loop starts its work in queues we already have callbacks because js engine goes onto code line by line and put it into call stack and only after call stack the async callbacks go to queue.

0. Any callbacks in the micro task queues are executed: first tasks in the next queue and only then tasks in the promise queue.
1. All callbacks in nextTick queue are executed before callbacks in promise queue
2. All callbacks within the timer queue are executed
3. Callbacks in the micro task queues if present are executed after the execution of every callback in the timer queue, again first tasks in the next queue and then tasks in the promise queue.
4. All callbacks within the io queue are executed 
5. Callbacks in the micro task queues if present are executed...
6. All callbacks in the check queue are executed 
7. Callbacks in the micro task queues if present are executed after the execution of every callback in the check queue again first tasks in the next queue and only then tasks in the promise queue.

If all callbacks are executed and there is no more code to process the event Loop exits.

Note: The functions(setTimeout, nextTick) get popped off from call stack, their callbacks will go to queues.

In case of microtasks loop first will execute cbs in nextTick que and then will go to promise queue. If event loop inside of promise queue it will continue execute promise cbs till finish the whole cbs even if this time new nextTick cbs have been entered in nextTick queue.
```js
process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log(1);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(2);
  process.nextTick(() => {
    console.log(4);
  });
});
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(3);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(5);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(6);
  process.nextTick(() => {
    console.log(7);
  });
});
```

### Timer

callbacks in the micro task queues are executed before callbacks in the timer queue.

If event loop inside of timer queue and in this time appear callbacks in microtasks, event loop will pause its work in timer phase will go to microtask, will execute the callback and after that will back to the timer phase.

- callbacks in micro task queues are executed in between the execution of callbacks in the timer queue. After every callback execution in the timer queue the event Loop goes back and checks the micro task queues if there is any callback. After ensuring that micro task queues are empty Event loop goes back to the timer queue.

### IO

When running setTimeout with a delay of 0 milliseconds along with an io async method, the order of execution can never be guaranteed.

```js
const fs = require("fs");

setTimeout(() => console.log("this is setTimeout 1"), 0);

fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  console.log("this is readFile 1");
});

```

IO queue callbacks are executed after microtask queue callbacks and timer queue callbacks.

It's important to know that callBack of readFile will appear in pool phase when it will finish its work. It means IO events are polled and callback functions are added to the io queue only after the input output operation is complete.
